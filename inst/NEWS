Changes in Version 0.99.8 (2018-03-21)
______________________________________

o dmrseq no longer requires balanced, two-group comparisons. To run using a 
  continuous or categorial covariate with more than two groups, simply pass in
  the name of a column in `pData` that contains this covariate. A continuous
  covariate is assmued if the data type in the `testCovariate` slot is 
  continuous, with the exception of if there are only two unique values (then a
  two group comparison is carried out).

Version 0.99.6 (2018-03-02)

o dmrseq is now available on Bioconductor devel (3.7) !
