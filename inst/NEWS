Changes in Version 1.0.10 (2018-06-19)
_____________________________________

o Bug fixes and improvements in region-level model fitting:
  - allow zero coverage loci with continuous covariate
  - more robust estimates of effect across multiple groups
  - ensure covariate type of adjustCovariate remains the same as in pData()
  - check for unstable fits and re-estimate without variance weighting
o Bug fixes and improvements in plotting routine:
  - properly handle custom plotting attributes 
  - more sensible defaults in colors for multi-group comparisons
  - restrict smoothing lines to 0,1 range on y-axis
o For factor comparisons, ensure that candidate regions have replicates (with 
  coverage at least 1) in each group for at least two CpGs within the region.
o The newly added `chrsPerChunk` argument specifies the number of chromosomes
  to compute at a time (default is 1). 

Changes in Version 0.99.11 (2018-04-05)
______________________________________

o dmrseq now provides support for detecting large-scale methylation blocks. To
  use this feature, specify `block=TRUE`, and increase the smoothing span 
  parameters `minInSpan`, `bpSpan`, and `maxGapSmooth`. More details are 
  provided in the documentation and vignette.

Changes in Version 0.99.8 (2018-03-21)
______________________________________

o dmrseq no longer requires balanced, two-group comparisons. To run using a 
  continuous or categorial covariate with more than two groups, simply pass in
  the name of a column in `pData` that contains this covariate. A continuous
  covariate is assmued if the data type in the `testCovariate` slot is 
  continuous, with the exception of if there are only two unique values (then a
  two group comparison is carried out).

Version 0.99.6 (2018-03-02)

o dmrseq is now available on Bioconductor devel (3.7) !
